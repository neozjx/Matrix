I never make a sound
Fingers crossed I shut my mouth
Thoughts they're creeping through my teeth
Drip, drop, the night is loud
Silence seems to drown me out
Box my thoughts and give me some relief
I wanna let you down
Make you toss and turn around
Won't you give me what I need
I wanna let you down
And I'm always lost and never found
Won't you give me what I need
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is it's fear
Did you plan on going to bed in the near future no
There's nothing to worry about you're going to be just fine
But whatever you do
Don't fall asleep
Don't drop the curtains down
Darkness is the whole surround
My mind is lurking at my feet (At my feet)
Criss, Cross, the night is sour
Pupils fixed on every hour
Sunrise is the only thing that's sweet
I wanna let you down
Make you toss and turn around
Won't you give me what I need (What I need)
I wanna let you down
And I'm always lost and never found
Won't you give me what I need
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending
Counting sheep oh
Never get no sleep
